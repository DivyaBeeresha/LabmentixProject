    "This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a survey focused on mental health in the tech industry. The main objective is to understand how various personal, professional, and organizational factors influence whether employees seek mental health treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes responses from over 1200 professionals working in tech and related fields. It covers key aspects such as age, gender, remote work, family history of mental illness, self-employment, company size, access to mental health benefits, workplace support, and perceptions of stigma.\n",
    "\n",
    "DATA PREPARATION\n",
    "The dataset was first cleaned and prepared through data wrangling techniques:\n",
    "Standardizing column names and categories (e.g., gender)\n",
    "Removing duplicates and unrealistic age values\n",
    "Handling missing values in key fields\n",
    "Converting inconsistent text responses into usable formats\n",
    "This ensured the dataset was reliable and analysis-ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "VISUAL ANALYSIS (15 CHARTS)\n",
    "Fifteen meaningful visualizations were created to explore relationships between key variables:\n",
    "1. Gender vs Mental Health Treatment\n",
    "2. Age Distribution Based on Treatment Status\n",
    "3. Remote Work vs Treatment\n",
    "4. Family History of Mental Illness vs Treatment\n",
    "5. Employer Mental Health Benefits vs Treatment\n",
    "6. Comfort Talking to Supervisor vs Treatment\n",
    "7. Comfort Talking to Coworkers vs Treatment\n",
    "8. Work Interference Due to Mental Health vs Treatment\n",
    "9. Perception of Mental Health vs Physical Health Equality vs Treatment\n",
    "10. Ease of Taking Mental Health Leave vs Treatment\n",
    "11. Company Size vs Mental Health Treatment\n",
    "12. Self-Employment Status vs Treatment\n",
    "13. Tech Company vs Non-Tech Company vs Treatment\n",
    "14. Willingness to Discuss Mental Health in Job Interviews vs Treatment\n",
    "15. Observed Negative Consequences at Work vs Treatment\n",
    "Each chart was analyzed for patterns, with key insights and business implications noted. These visualizations helped uncover both supportive factors and barriers that influence treatment behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "KEY INSIGHTS\n",
    "Males, self-employed workers, and small-company employees are less likely to seek help.\n",
    "Employees who feel supported by supervisors and coworkers, or are aware of mental health benefits, are more likely to seek treatment.\n",
    "A lack of communication, stigma, or fear of consequences are major barriers.\n",
    "Employees who experience work interference due to mental health are more likely to seek support, but often only when symptoms affect performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "BUSINESS IMPACT\n",
    "The insights from this analysis can guide companies to:\n",
    "Offer and promote clear mental health resources\n",
    "Train leaders and HR teams to support employees without judgment\n",
    "Normalize mental health conversations across all teams\n",
    "Design inclusive policies that protect employee well-being\n",
    "These changes can lead to improved engagement, reduced burnout, and higher retention in tech environments."
